# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
# for example, the string aabbccdd would become a2b2c2d2. If the compressed string would not become 
# smaller than the the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume 
# the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
